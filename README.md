Bytelab's old website hosted on github pages and can be found at https://bytelab.rafaelcenzano.com

Bytelab was a coding club at Lowell High School during 2017 - 2019

It has been replaced by [Lowell Dev Club](https://www.lowelldev.club). Lowell Dev Club was created by [Rafael](https://rafaelcenzano.com) and [Cappillen](https://www.cappillenlee.com) who were members of Bytelab the whole time it exsisted. Lowell Dev Club was built to take what Bytelab had originally started and to improve and expand it.
